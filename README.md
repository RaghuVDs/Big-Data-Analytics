# Flight Price Prediction with PySpark

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting and optimizing flight prices (`totalFare`) using a dataset of flight itineraries. It leverages Apache Spark (PySpark) for efficient data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning model building. The project demonstrates a comprehensive data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploration to model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Goals

*   Build a robust data engineering pipeline to process and transform a large dataset of flight itineraries.
*   Engineer insightful features from raw data to capture the key factors influencing flight prices.
*   Develop and evaluate several machine learning regression models to accurately predict flight prices.
*   Optimize model hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance.
*   Gain practical experience in using PySpark for big data processing and machine learning.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing information about flight itineraries, including:

*   **Search details:** Date, origin, destination, etc.
*   **Flight details:** Date, airline, flight number, etc.
*   **Fare information:** Base fare, total fare, etc.
*   **Segment details:** Information about individual flight segments (for multi-leg flights).

## Tools and Technologies

*   **Apache Spark (PySpark):** For distributed data processing and machine learning.
*   **Python:** Primary programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms (if used in combination with PySpark MLlib).
*   **PySpark MLlib:** For machine learning algorithms within Spark.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and documentation.
